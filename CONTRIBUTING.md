# Contributing to Evil Kiwi Open Source

At Evil Kiwi we aim to give back to the Developer communities we engage in as often as possible - as such,
we maintain various Open Source libraries and software, both related to the Evil Kiwi Ecosystem and otherwise.

We're always welcome to feedback, PRs and constructive criticism of our software.

## Code of Conduct

We employ the [Contributor Covenant 2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/)
Code of Conduct for our Open Source systems. By submitting PRs, Issues or contributing towards our software
in any other means, you agree to follow the conduct laid out.

Please let us know [via Discord](https://discord.gg/3S6AKZ2GR9) if you feel someone is not doing so.

## I have a question!

Do not use the Issues section to ask questions regarding our Open Source software - instead, if you feel
comfortable using Discord, [join ours](https://discord.gg/3S6AKZ2GR9) and ask any questions you may have in
our `#open-source` channel.

## I've found an issue with the library/software

In this case, feel free to open a [Bug Report](https://github.com/evilkiwi/embed/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)
and fully explain the Issue to us. If you don't explain in enough detail, it makes it much harder to diagnose.

Ideally we'd love a minimal set-up that reproduces the issue.

## I have a PR which fixes a bug/adds a new feature

Great! We'd love to see it!

- Open a PR against this repository
- Explain in detail what the PR does and why you are submitting it
- Add any additional info
  - For example, if this is a new feature, provide your fork with a working example

## Final notes

From the Evil Kiwi Team, thank you for considering contributing to our Open Source software - we do our best
to work on and maintain anything we feel would benefit the software, as well as requests from the community,
but our priority is always based on the Evil Kiwi Ecosystem itself. Contributions are a great way to give back!
